# ByteBites
All Problems Published on coderbyte.com, with solutions.

In addition to simply having the solutions, each problem will have a matching .spec file, which includes tests run on each problem. The repository uses Jasmine for testing, and also applies eslint. I have found eslint to be enormously helpful in learning to write clean code, even when I decide to override a particular rule.

### For Beginners
There is more in this repository than just the code that solves the problems. To take advantage of what it has to offer, it will be necessary to install NodeJS on your computer (easy to do at nodejs.org). After it is installed (it will also install with a tool called node package manager, or npm), go to your terminal command line, navigate to the ByteBites directory, and enter the command:
  ```
  npm install
  ```
  This should install the software needed to run the tests (called Jasmine) and to check for improperly formatted code (call es-lint). Testing is a very important thing to learn, but somewhat difficult to acquire on one's own. Hopefully the tests included here may provide some helpful examples.
  
  Finally, I encourage you very strongly to read the problem at the top of each file, then close the file and try to solve it yourself. Code is like sheet music - one can look at it and think it all makes sense, but one learns to code by actually coding, not looking at code. If you do get truly stuck on a problem and decide to sneak a peak at my, or someone else's solution, you should not move on until you can sit down without that solution in front of you and write the complete solution yourself (not from memory, but from the principles you now understand).
